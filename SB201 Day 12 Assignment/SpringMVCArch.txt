Q1/- Explain the Java-based Spring MVC architecture

Spring MVC means model-view-controller.

Previeously there is MVC model where we use servlet class 
in that we validate the data which comes from web application then servlet class
gives that data to service layer to perform business logic service layer called
the method from data access layer to perform business logic on client data for that data 
access layer fetch data from database and gives to data access layer.
after that service layer perform the business logic and it gives back to servlet class.
and servlet gives it to JSP beacuse jsp is easy to handle when there is rich UI.
so jsp show the final data to client.

In this Servlet works as controller because it is just controlling the flow of wholeprocess.
jsp work as view in this because it presents the data to client
and model mean java bean class because in java data stores as object and we are using bean class
to create object.

In Spring MVC we dont need this servlet class we can directly use Spring boot framework dipatcher
servelt class.we dont need to configure servlet class so it's gives less burden to devloper.
