Q3/- What is the difference between WebApplication and Web-services?

A3/- Web services is a part of WebApplication.

In WebApplication we can generate a   html form like a webpage response.
but in Webservice we can get the data in raw form like json,xml etc

in Webapplication we can deploy our html page in webserver only like browse software etc
but in Webservice we can use that raw data for browser software or anytype of application
in any technology.

Webapplication response is not reusable because we deploy in it webserver
whereas Web service data is reusable any other application or webapplication
use that data and present it's in thier own browser.
