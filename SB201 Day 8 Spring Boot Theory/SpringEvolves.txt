Q4/- Write Short notes on how the Spring framework evolves.

A4.As we know that to build Enterprise Application we have to do many repeated things
and that will be very much burden on devloper.

to reduce this burden so that devloper can focus on main service logic there is technology 
comes which name is EJB.

EJB can able to thode middlewere services so that devloper can focus on their business logic.

but this EJB components are very weight and required too many storage to build.
and also very much complex.because its have too many interfaces we have to implement
in our service logic whether we want it or not.

so EJB is very much complex thing and also very heavy weight too.

too overcome this problem in 2004 Johnson created Spring Framework.

Spring is framework which reduces the work of frameworks too.it's lightweight and we can
use it in pojo class too
