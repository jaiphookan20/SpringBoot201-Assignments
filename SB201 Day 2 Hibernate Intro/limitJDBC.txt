Q2.limitation of JDBC based persistence logic over JPA
A2.
1) In JDBC we can't store java objects directely to database table.we have to convert that object
into simple value to store it in database table.

2)Here JDBC depends on database software because the query we write in JDBC depends on that
software so we cannot use that code in different database software.

3) There is lots of checked exception to handle

4) Some repetation of same code(we reduces that code using DAO pattern).

5) ResultSet object in JDBC we can't transfer from one layer to another layer.
also we need to structure ResultSet object to retrive our data

6) there is no caching and transaction supports in JDBC
