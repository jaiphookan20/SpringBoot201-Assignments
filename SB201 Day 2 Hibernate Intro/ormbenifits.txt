Q5. Why to use ORM and What are the benefits of ORM?
A5.
ORM means object relation mapping.It means we can map our object to database directly.
Using ORM software we can directly stores object in database.

these are the benefits of using ORM software.

-> ORM is database independent.We can write all the logic in from of our java object so that logic will be
    database independent.so we can reuse that code in different database software.

-> ORM software takes object as input and also give object as output so we dont need to convert it into atomic value.
